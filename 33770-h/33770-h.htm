<h2>A PRE-IMPERTINENCE.</h2>


<p>Anticipating the intelligent critic of "Impertinent Poems," it may well
be remarked that the chief impertinence is in calling them poems. Be
that as it may, the editors and publishers of "The Saturday Evening
Post," "Success" and "Ainslee's," and, in a lesser degree,
"Metropolitan," "Independent," "Booklovers'" and "New York Herald" share
with the author the reproach of first promoting their publicity. That
they are now willing to further reduce their share of the burden by
dividing it with the present publishers entitles them to the thanks of
the author and the gratitude of the book-buying public.</p>

<span class="i0">You don't buy poetry. (Neither do I.)<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Why?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You cannot afford it? Bosh! you spend<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Editions de luxe</i> on a thirsty friend.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You can buy any one of the poetry bunch<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the price you pay for a business lunch.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Don't you suppose that a hungry head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like an empty stomach, ought to be fed?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looking into myself, I find this true,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So I hardly can figure it false in you.<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>

<span class="i0">And you don't <i>read</i> poetry very much.<br /></span>
<span class="i8">(Such<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is my own case also.) "But," you cry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I haven't the time." Beloved, you lie.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When a scandal happens in Buffalo,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You ponder the details, con and pro;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If poets were pugilists, couldn't you tell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which of the poets licked John L.?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If poets were counts, could your wife be fooled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As to which of the poets married a Gould?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And even <i>my</i> books might have some hope<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If poetry books were books of dope.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"You're a little bit swift," you say to me,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Your "favorite poets," row on row,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chaucer, Shakespeare, Tennyson, Poe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A Homer unread, an uncut Horace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A wholly forgotten William Morris.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My friend, my friend, can it be you thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That these were poets whom you had bought?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These are dead men's bones. You bought their mummies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To display your style, like clothing dummies.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when do they talk to you? Some one said<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That these were poets which should be read,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So here they stand. But tell me, pray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How many poets who live to-day<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Have you, of your own volition, sought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Discovered and tested, proved and <i>bought</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a grateful glow that the dollar you spent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Netted the poet his ten per cent.?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"But hold on," you say, "I am reading <i>you</i>."<br /></span>
<span class="i8">True,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pitying, too, the sorry end<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the dog I tried this on. My friend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I <i>can</i> write poetry&mdash;good enough<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So you wouldn't look at the worthy stuff.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But knowing what you prefer to read<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That no matter what one may say, or write,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The theme is old and the lesson is trite,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which is what you may say, as these lines unreel<br /></span>

<span class="i0">There's a strong temptation to open your door<br /></span>

<span class="i12">That you're sore.<br /></span>
